  Abstract                 = {In computed torque control, robot dynamics are predicted by dynamic models. This enables more compliant control, as the gains of the feedback term can be lowered, because the task of compensating for robot dynamics is delegated from the feedback to the feedforward term. Previous work has shown that Gaussian process regression is an effective method for learning computed torque control, by setting the feedforward torques to the mean of the Gaussian process. We extend this work by also exploiting the variance predicted by the Gaussian process, by lowering the gains if the variance is low. This enables an automatic adaptation of the gains to the uncertainty in the computed torque model, and leads to more compliant low-gain control as the robot learns more accurate models over time. On a simulated 7-DOF robot manipulator, we demonstrate how accurate tracking is achieved, despite the gains being lowered over time.},

The controllers range from simple analog PD (proportional-derivative) control applied independently at each joint to feedforward and computed torque methods incorporating full dynamics. It was found that trajectory tracking errors decreased as more dynamic compensation terms were incorporated. There was no significant difference in trajectory tracking performance between the feedforward controller using independent digital servos and the full computed torque controller. Implementing the model-based controller highlights the need for accurate control of joint torque, accurate joint position and velocity sensing, and adequate sampling rates},

The algorithm is derived from the Newton-Euler equations, and uses measurements of the joint torques as well as the measurement and calculation of the kinematics of the manipulator while it is moving. The identification equations are linear in the desired unknown parameters, and a modified least squares algorithm is used to obtain estimates of these parameters. Some of the parameters, however, are not identifiable due to the restricted motion of proximal links and the lack of full force/torque sensing. The algorithm was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was obtained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques computed from motor currents.},

If the possible bound of the uncertainty is known, a class of non-adaptive robust computed torque control schems is used. The control guarantees the tracking error to be confined within a specified region after a finite time. If the bound of uncertainty is unknown, a class of adaptive robust computed torque control schemes is used. The control guarantees the tracking error to converge to zero. Both classes of controls are continous and no statistical information on the uncertainty is ever assumed, nor is such information used. Use of the controls is illustrated by a two-link planar robot manipulator. The resulting system performance is compared with that of the manipulator when the traditional computed torque control scheme is employed.},

The main challenge in the motion control problem of rigid manipulators is the complexity of their dynamics and uncertainties. The former results from nonlinearity and coupling in the robot manipulators. The latter is twofold: structured and unstructured. Structured uncertainty means imprecise knowledge of the dynamic parameters and will be touched upon in this chapter, whereas unstructured uncertainty results from joint and link flexibility, actuator dynamics, friction, sensor noise, and unknown environment dynamics, and will be treated in other chapters.},

We compare the computed-torque control scheme with the feedforward dynamics compensation scheme. The feedforward scheme compensates for the manipulator dy namics in the feedforward path, whereas the computed-torque scheme uses the dynamics in the feedback loop for lineariza tion and decoupling.

This feature increases the potential of the computed-torque control scheme to handle practical constraint in actual robots such as presence of friction in the joints and actuators with limited torque capabilities. We illustrate this potential by means of a fuzzy self-tuning algorithm to select the proportional and derivative gains according to the actual tracking position error.

  Abstract                 = {Computed-torque control is a well known motion control strategy for manipulators which ensures global asymptotic stability for fixed symmetric positive definite (proportional and derivative) gain matrices. We show that the global asymptotic stability attribute also holds for a class of gain matrices depending on the manipulators state. This feature increases the potential of the computed-torque scheme to handle practical constraints in actual robots such as presence of friction in the joints and actuators with limited torque capabilities. We illustrate this potential by means of a fuzzy self-tuning algorithm to select the proportional and derivative gains according to the actual tracking position error. Experiments on a two degrees of freedom robot arm shown the usefulness of the proposed approach},

However, in some cases the accuracy of rigid-body models does not suffice for sound control performance due to unmodeled nonlinearities such as hydraulic cables, complex friction, or actuator dynamics. In such cases, learning the models from data poses an interesting alternative and estimating the dynamics model using regression techniques becomes an important problem. However, the most accurate regression methods, e.g. Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), suffer from exceptional high computational complexity which prevents their usage for large numbers of samples or online learning to date. We proposed an approximation to the standard GPR using local Gaussian processes models inspired by [Vijayakumaf, 2005 and Snelson and Ghahramani, 2007]. Due to reduced computational cost, local Gaussian processes (LGP) is capable for an online learning. Comparisons with other nonparametric regressions, e.g. standard GPR, v-SVR and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and v-SVR while being sufficiently fast for online learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Computed torque control allows the design of considerably more precise, energy-efficient and compliant controls for robots. However, the major obstacle is the requirement of an accurate model for torque generation, which cannot be obtained in some cases using rigid-body formulations due to unmodeled nonlinearities, such as complex friction or actuator dynamics. In such cases, models approximated from robot data present an appealing alternative. In this paper, we compare two non- parametric regression methods for model approximation, i.e., locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). While locally weighted regression was employed for real-time model estimation in learning adaptive control, Gaussian process regression has not been used in control to-date due to high computational requirements. The comparison includes the assessment of model approximation for both regression methods using data originated from SARCOS robot arm, as well as an evaluation of the robot tracking performance in computed torque control employing the approximated models. Our results show that GPR can be applied for realtime control achieving higher accuracy. However, for the online learning LWPR is superior by reason of lower computational requirements.},

The resulting controller consists of two loops. The inner loop is for the full compensation for manipulators nonlinear dynamics and the outer loop is the CNF for stabilisation and performance enhancement. Stability analysis is carried out with an estimate of the domain of attraction specified in the presence of actuator saturation. In addition to the guaranteed stability properties, the controller takes advantage of a varying damping ratio induced by the CNF control. The varying damping ratio allows fast transient response without overshoot and compensates the effect of the frictions. It also takes advantage of the high-gain action embedded in the outer loop to compensate the friction effect. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

The single modeling of friction behavior, even if comprehensive and accurate enough, appears to be insufficient for accurately compensating the friction disturbances, due to their time- and state-varying nature. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear friction observer aimed at the motion control. We analyze the uncertainties of viscous and Coulomb friction and derive an asymptotic observer for two-state friction dynamics without assuming a particular dynamic friction model. The linear observer gains prove to be sufficient for achieving an accurate friction estimate with a controllable eigenbehavior. Furthermore, we analyze the friction observer within the linear feedback loop and describe the required system identification and design of controller. An experimental case study accomplished on a rotary actuator system is provided for evaluating both the friction observer and its use for precise positioning.},

  Abstract                 = {In this note, we investigate the adaptive control problem for robot manipulators with both the uncertain kinematics and dynamics. We propose two adaptive control schemes to realize the objective of task-space trajectory tracking irrespective of the uncertain kinematics and dynamics. The proposed controllers have the desirable separation property, and we also show that the first adaptive controller with appropriate modifications can yield the improved performance, without the expense of the conservative gain choice. The performance of the proposed controllers is shown by numerical simulations.},
