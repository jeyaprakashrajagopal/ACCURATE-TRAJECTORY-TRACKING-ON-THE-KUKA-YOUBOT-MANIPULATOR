abstract={The authors present a nonlinear compensator using neural networks for trajectory control of robotic manipulators. The neural networks are not used to learn inverse-dynamics but to compensate nonlinearities of robotic manipulators. The performance of the proposed neural network controller is compared with that of the adaptive controller proposed by J.J. Craig (1988), and the effectiveness of the proposed neural network controller in compensating the unstructured uncertainties is clarified. A learning scheme using a model of known dynamics of manipulators is also proposed. The model learning can be done offline and needs no data recording of actual manipulator operation.<<ETX>>},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses experimental robot identification based on a statistical framework. It presents a new approach toward the design of optimal robot excitation trajectories, and formulates the maximum-likelihood estimation of dynamic robot model parameters. The differences between the new design approach and the existing approaches lie in the parameterization of the excitation trajectory and in the optimization criterion. The excitation trajectory for each joint is a finite Fourier series. This approach guarantees periodic excitation which is advantageous because it allows: 1) time-domain data averaging; 2) estimation of the characteristics of the measurement noise, which is valuable in case of maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. In addition, the use of finite Fourier series allows calculation of the joint velocities and accelerations in an analytic way from the measured position response, and allows specification of the bandwidth of the excitation trajectories. The optimization criterion is the uncertainty on the estimated parameters or a lower bound for it, instead of the often used condition of the parameter estimation problem. Simulations show that this criterion yields parameter estimates with smaller uncertainty bounds than trajectories optimized according to the classical criterion. Experiments on an industrial robot show that the presented trajectory design and maximum-likelihood parameter estimation approaches complement each other to make a practicable robot identification technique which yields accurate robot models.},

For a robot that requires to only complete straight path navigation, the cascade controller is an attractive solution. Compared to typical mobile robot navigation algorithms, this cascade control does not need any path tracking control and only uses simple PID for navigation. For each mobile robot wheels, a position PID controller is cascaded to a velocity PID controller. An additional PID controller is added in between both wheels to make sure the mobile robot moves in a straight path. An experiment was done on a differential drive robot and results were presented.},

It was found that trajectory tracking errors decreased as more dynamic compensation terms were incorporated. There was no significant difference in trajectory tracking performance between the feedforward controller using independent digital servos and the full computed torque controller. Implementing the model-based controller highlights the need for accurate control of joint torque, accurate joint position and velocity sensing, and adequate sampling rates},

The algorithm is derived from the Newton-Euler equations, and uses measurements of the joint torques as well as the measurement and calculation of the kinematics of the manipulator while it is moving. The identification equations are linear in the desired unknown parameters, and a modified least squares algorithm is used to obtain estimates of these parameters. Some of the parameters, however, are not identifiable due to the restricted motion of proximal links and the lack of full force/torque sensing. The algorithm was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was obtained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques computed from motor currents.},

It is shown that the computed-torque scheme outperforms the independent joint control scheme as long as there is not torque saturation in the actuators. Based on the experimental results, the authors conclusively establish the importance of compensating for the nonlinear Coriolis and centrifugal forces even at low speeds of operation},

  Abstract                 = { The manipulator trajectory tracking control problem revolves around computing the torques to be applied to achieve accu rate tracking. This problem has been extensively studied in simulations, but real-time results have been lacking in the robotics literature. In this paper, we present the experimental results of the real-time performance of model-based control algorithms. We compare the computed-torque control scheme with the feedforward dynamics compensation scheme. The feedforward scheme compensates for the manipulator dy namics in the feedforward path, whereas the computed-torque scheme uses the dynamics in the feedback loop for lineariza tion and decoupling. The parameters in the dynamics model for the computed-torque and feedforward schemes were esti mated by using an identification algorithm. Our experiments underscore the importance of including the off-diagonal terms of the manipulator inertia matrix in the torque compu tation. This observation is further supported by our analysis of the dynamics equations. The manipulator control schemes have been implemented on the CMU DD arm II with a sam pling period of 2 ms. },

However, in some cases the accuracy of rigid-body models does not suffice for sound control performance due to unmodeled nonlinearities such as hydraulic cables, complex friction, or actuator dynamics. In such cases, learning the models from data poses an interesting alternative and estimating the dynamics model using regression techniques becomes an important problem. However, the most accurate regression methods, e.g. Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), suffer from exceptional high computational complexity which prevents their usage for large numbers of samples or online learning to date. We proposed an approximation to the standard GPR using local Gaussian processes models inspired by [Vijayakumaf, 2005 and Snelson and Ghahramani, 2007]. Due to reduced computational cost, local Gaussian processes (LGP) is capable for an online learning. Comparisons with other nonparametric regressions, e.g. standard GPR, v-SVR and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and v-SVR while being sufficiently fast for online learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Computed torque control allows the design of considerably more precise, energy-efficient and compliant controls for robots. However, the major obstacle is the requirement of an accurate model for torque generation, which cannot be obtained in some cases using rigid-body formulations due to unmodeled nonlinearities, such as complex friction or actuator dynamics. In such cases, models approximated from robot data present an appealing alternative. In this paper, we compare two non- parametric regression methods for model approximation, i.e., locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). While locally weighted regression was employed for real-time model estimation in learning adaptive control, Gaussian process regression has not been used in control to-date due to high computational requirements. The comparison includes the assessment of model approximation for both regression methods using data originated from SARCOS robot arm, as well as an evaluation of the robot tracking performance in computed torque control employing the approximated models. Our results show that GPR can be applied for realtime control achieving higher accuracy. However, for the online learning LWPR is superior by reason of lower computational requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {On the basis of the classical computed torque control method, a composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) design method for robot manipulators with bounded torques is presented. The resulting controller consists of two loops. The inner loop is for the full compensation for manipulators nonlinear dynamics and the outer loop is the CNF for stabilisation and performance enhancement. Stability analysis is carried out with an estimate of the domain of attraction specified in the presence of actuator saturation. In addition to the guaranteed stability properties, the controller takes advantage of a varying damping ratio induced by the CNF control. The varying damping ratio allows fast transient response without overshoot and compensates the effect of the frictions. It also takes advantage of the high-gain action embedded in the outer loop to compensate the friction effect. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

The control scheme is applied to a seven degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator, and the system performance in standard tasks is evaluated using both dynamic simulation and actual experiments.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents modelling and control design of ED 7220C - a vertical articulated serial arm having 5 revolute joints with 6 Degree Of Freedom. Both the direct and inverse kinematic models have been developed. For analysis of forces and to facilitate the controller design, svstem dynamics have been formulated. A non-linear control technique, Computed Torque Control (CTC) has been presented. The algorithm, implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, utilizes the derived dynamics as well as linear control techniques. Simulation results dearly demonstrate the efficacy of the presented approach in terms of traiectory tracking Various responses of the arm joints have been recorded to characterize the performance of the control algorithm. The research finds its applications in simulation of advance nonlinear and robust control techniques as well as their implementation on the physical platform.},
